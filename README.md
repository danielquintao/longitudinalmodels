# longitudinalmodels

This project aims at  providing trustworthy and easy-to-use code for the estimation of different longitudinal models.

In the folder ```extra``` we find the implementation of some pipelines that deals with most of the boring part for applying or models, and also manages data to be outputed.

The folder ```models``` contains the imlementations of our models. There are:
- GCM (Growth Curve Model)
- Extended GCM  (GCM with a covariable encoding kown groups to which the subjetcs belong). The groups are **not** time-dependent (i.e. each subject belongs to the same group throughout all the study)
- GCM (Growth Curve Model)
- LCGA (Latent Class Growth Analysis), which is a mixture of regressions. It combines clustering and linear regression

The folder ```test``` contains sample data and testing code to evaluate our models. This is not a traditional "test folder" as we encounter in many software repositories to allow for safe pull requests

The folder utils has auxiliary methods for the models and pipelines, in particular for plotting
