1- study model specificity
    * " unconstrained estimation results in simpler asymptotic distributions and has greater
        power in detecting structural misspecification related to negative error variance 
        estimates" - Testing Negative Error Variances, Bollen, Kolenikov

1.2-  check inversibilité de R+ZDZ' -- OK

1.3- tester time-indep error avec données réelles -- OK (no warning)

2- revisit lavaan source code : how does it model the likelihood? Why does it happen to
   have negative variance? I THINK that lavaan may use directly the sample variance instead
   of directly using the y_i as I do (they may use the FIML presented in Preacher and in
   the paper "Testing if Negative [...]" from Bollen and Kolenikov)

3- Consider:
    - multiple starting values (either to "search the global max" or to state that the model is not
      identified if there exist non-global maxima - "Marc Lavielle, Leon Aarons. What do we mean by
      identifiability in mixed effects models?. 2016.hal-01251986") -- NO 
    - removing the implicitly added constants to see what happen -- FIASCO w/ MLE => try FIML
    - try another estimator in lavaan, or even another software to see if the problem is
      with (my implementation in) lavaan or with the model itself
    - using profile likelihood to check structural and practical identifiability (Raue et al)
    - use the "Fisher Information Matrix" as an heuristics to detect identifiability (again, "Marc 
      Lavielle, Leon Aarons. What do we mean by identifiability in mixed effects models?")
    - Study if this is model mispecification with Likelihood Ratio Tests (Chi2-difference)

4- Add statistics (chi2, z-value, etc) and further convergence information

5- new datasets, more tests

(after) - tirar modelo "normal" (R completo) se a identifibilidade for definida para o beta
e para (R,D) separadamente

(after) - fix header comments
