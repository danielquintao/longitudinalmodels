what's H1 in lavaan ?
What's the baselie model in lavaan?
How to visualize the matrix representation of the model?


useful lavaan functions:
coef(fit) to get the parameters values more directly
fitted(fit) -- vs -- inspectSampleCov(model, dataset) (the difference between the latter and the former is given by residuals(fit))
parameterEstimates(fit) & summary(fit) --> view several statistics and results at once
lavInspect(fit [,what='list']) --> internal representation of the model!
    - Parameters to be estimated are called 1,2,3,... (if what='partable', non-zero vals include fixed params)
    - columns are mean structs, triangular matrices are cov matrices, others are relations 'a -> b'
    - other VERY USEFUL options for 'what' can be found in https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lavaan/versions/0.6-8/topics/lavInspect
AIC(fit), BIC(fit), fitMeasures(fit) --> more precise statistics

How does lavaan compute the MLE (and related stuff):
- see in lines 29,30 of lav_model_compute.R that computeSigmaHat has a param 'extra' that
  says if we should check whether sigma hat is positive-definite or not. This option is TRUE
  in lav_model_estimate for the initial value of the estimation (lines 404, 407), TRUE also
  in lav_model_objective.R when estimator is 'ML', and similarly for the gradient.
  If 'extra' is TRUE and the Sigma.hat is NOT positive definite (which is checked as 
  "some eigenvalue is practically zero" || sum(eigenvalues) == 0), then lavaan computes the
  generalized inverse (with MASS::ginv) and set Sigma.inv to this value, sets the log det as
  log(.Machine$double.eps), and sets the flag "po" to FALSE. Actually, it looks like this 
  pseudoinverse and this log det of log(.Machine$double.eps) make no difference at all for
  the estimator option "ML" (see estimator.ML() in lav_objective.R) checks for the flag "po"
  and returns Inf if this is FALSE.
